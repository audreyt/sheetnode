SHEETNODE v7.x

A module to host spreadsheets as Drupal nodes.



INSTALLATION

Please refer to http://www.drupal.org/project/sheetnode for installation instructions.



STATUS
The 7.x version of sheetnode has been ported from the 6.x version and has been 
successfully tested to display, edit and delete sheetnodes under Drupal 7.10. Similar 
to the 6.x version, the 7.x installation requires the socialcalc download. The 
socialcalc that is used for the 6.x installation works also for the 7.x installation.
